#   The following is the body of the script. By default,
#   PBS scripts execute in your home directory, not the
#   directory from which they were submitted. The following
#   line places you in the directory from which the job
#   was submitted.
#
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
#
#   Now we want to run the program "hello".  "hello" is in
#   the directory that this script is being submitted from,
#   $PBS_O_WORKDIR.
